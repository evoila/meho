"""Shared ``?envelope=v2`` opt-in helper for list endpoints (G0.16-T6 Finding A).

The convention doc (``docs/codebase/api-shape-conventions.md`` §2)
names the unified list-endpoint shape::

    {
      "items": [ ... ],
      "next_cursor": "<opaque string | null>",
      "budget_status": { ... }   # optional sidecar
    }

This module carries the small bits of glue every list endpoint
adopting the opt-in needs:

* :data:`EnvelopeVersion` — the literal type for the
  ``?envelope=`` query parameter. Today the only accepted value is
  ``"v2"``; the absence of the parameter (``None``) means the
  endpoint should return its v0.8.0 default shape so no client
  breaks.
* :data:`ENVELOPE_QUERY` — a reusable FastAPI :class:`Query`
  declaration. Endpoints accept it as a typed parameter; the type
  system covers the validation, the description text covers the
  operator-facing help in the OpenAPI doc.
* :func:`wrap_v2_envelope` — given a list of items (already
  serialised to JSON-safe dicts) plus optional sidecars, returns
  the unified envelope dict. Mirrors the §2 contract: items always
  first, ``next_cursor`` always second (``None`` when this page is
  the last; the field is *present* either way), sidecars at the
  top level (not under a ``meta`` envelope) so a client that only
  reads ``items`` doesn't walk extra structure.

The migration path codified in §2 of the convention doc — add a
``?envelope=v2`` opt-in, flip the default after two release
cycles, remove the bare/keyed shape three releases later — is
why this helper exists as a separate module rather than as a
private helper inside :mod:`meho_backplane.api.v1.targets`: the
identical helper lands on every list endpoint that opts in, and
the consolidation point is the convention doc, not any one
endpoint.

Code reference: see :func:`meho_backplane.api.v1.targets.list_targets`
for the reference adoption (the first endpoint widened to honour the
opt-in). All five §2 list endpoints now accept the opt-in: the
``targets`` reference and the topology ``dependents`` /
``dependencies`` endpoints (G0.16-T6 Finding A #1312), plus the four
sister endpoints
(``conventions`` / ``audit/my-recent`` / ``broadcast/overrides``
/ ``connectors``) widened by G0.18-T3 (#1356), completing #1312
acceptance A. The MCP sister tools are v2-native (they call the
service layer in-process and return their own list shapes, with no
HTTP ``?envelope=`` param to forward); the CLI typed clients consume
the v0.8.0 default shape, so neither forwards the param.

        items: The serialised list contents. Caller is responsible
            for the per-item shape (typically the endpoint's existing
            response_model entry projected via ``model_dump(mode='json')``
            so UUIDs / datetimes render as strings; same shape the
            bare list would have carried in the v0.8.0 response).
        next_cursor: Forward-only continuation cursor; ``None`` when
            the current page exhausted the matching set. The field
            is always present in the envelope so clients can read
            ``response["next_cursor"]`` without a ``KeyError`` guard.
        **sidecars: Endpoint-specific top-level fields
            (e.g. ``budget_status`` for ``conventions``). Per §2 the
            sidecars are NOT nested under a ``meta`` envelope.

        ``{"items": items, "next_cursor": next_cursor, **sidecars}``.
        ``items`` first, ``next_cursor`` second, sidecars trailing
        so the JSON renders with a predictable order
        (Python ``dict`` preserves insertion order since 3.7;
        FastAPI's JSON encoder preserves the order through
        :func:`json.dumps`).
