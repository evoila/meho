# Vault provisioning — consumer-side requirements

## Why this lives in `evoila/meho`

The federation chain is wired in `backend/src/meho_backplane/auth/vault.py`
and exercised on every authenticated request to `/api/v1/health`.
When the chassis changes the shape of "what Vault must accept" — a
new audience, a new mount path, a new KV layout — this document
changes in lock-step with the code; the consumer's provisioning
runbook doesn't need to know about chassis-side renames as long as
the contract on this page holds.

## What the backplane needs

Five distinct Vault surfaces. The first four ship via Goal #11's
cross-repo deps (consumer commitment #5 — see
[`#261`](https://github.com/evoila-bosnia/claude-rdc-hetzner-dc/issues/261)
in the consumer repo). The fifth — the federation-proof test KV
path — is the surface most easily missed during provisioning.

### 1. JWT auth method — on a **dedicated mount**

The backplane authenticates with Vault's **JWT auth method**
(`auth.jwt.jwt_login` → `POST /auth/<mount>/login`; see
[`backend/src/meho_backplane/auth/vault.py`](../../backend/src/meho_backplane/auth/vault.py)),
forwarding the operator/service JWT for JWKS validation. It does
**not** use the interactive `vault login -method=oidc` flow. Mount the
JWT method at a **dedicated path** — `auth/jwt` matches the
backplane's default `VAULT_OIDC_MOUNT_PATH` (`jwt`):

```bash
vault auth enable -path=jwt jwt
vault write auth/jwt/config \
  oidc_discovery_url=https://<keycloak-host>/realms/<realm> \
  oidc_discovery_ca_pem=@<ca.pem> \
  default_role=meho-mcp
```

`oidc_discovery_ca_pem` is only needed when Keycloak presents an
internal-CA cert. Any mount path works — set `VAULT_OIDC_MOUNT_PATH`
to match (e.g. `-path=jwt-meho` ↔ `VAULT_OIDC_MOUNT_PATH=jwt-meho`).
The discovery URL must match `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER_URL` in the backplane's
ConfigMap exactly. Trailing slashes are normalised on the producer
side.

> **Do not put this on an `auth/oidc/` mount.** Once a mount is in
> OIDC-login mode (`oidc_discovery_url` + `oidc_client_id` set), Vault
> (confirmed on 1.21.2) rejects a `role_type=jwt` role on that same
> mount — login fails with `error configuring token validator:

> [`evoila-bosnia/claude-rdc-hetzner-dc#524`](https://github.com/evoila-bosnia/claude-rdc-hetzner-dc/issues/524).)

### 2. Role `meho-mcp`

Bound to the Keycloak realm and to the backplane's audience, on the
dedicated `jwt` mount from surface 1. Default role name `meho-mcp`
per [`backend/src/meho_backplane/settings.py`](../../backend/src/meho_backplane/settings.py)'s
`VAULT_OIDC_ROLE`; configurable via env var if a different name fits
the operator's Vault conventions.

```bash
vault write auth/jwt/role/meho-mcp \
  role_type=jwt \
  user_claim=sub \
  bound_audiences=<keycloak-audience> \
  policies=meho-mcp \
  token_ttl=1h
```

The `bound_audiences` value must match `KEYCLOAK_AUDIENCE` in the
backplane's ConfigMap. (Substitute `jwt` with your chosen mount path
if you didn't use the default.)

### 3. Policy `meho-mcp`

Grants the role the read paths the backplane exercises. v0.1 needs
**read** on the entire `secret/meho/*` subtree because operators
delegate per-secret authorisation to their Keycloak group
membership (groups → Vault external-group bindings → richer
policies) rather than per-path Vault policy:

```hcl
path "secret/data/meho/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "secret/metadata/meho/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

Both paths are required: KV v2 splits the secret value (`/data/`)
from its metadata (`/metadata/`); the backplane reads `/data/`
through hvac's `secrets.kv.v2.read_secret_version`, and the read
also touches `/metadata/` to honour `raise_on_deleted_version`.

### 4. KV v2 mount at `secret/`

The default Vault convention. Configurable via `vault.paths.kv` in
the chart (default `secret/meho`); the backplane reads under that
prefix.

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=secret -version=2 kv  # if not already
```

Existing labs that already have `secret/` mounted as KV v2 (the
default in fresh Vault installs) don't need to do this; the policy
above will Just Work.

### 5. Federation-proof test KV path `secret/meho/test/federation`

**This is the surface most easily missed.** The producer-side
`/api/v1/health` handler reads `secret/meho/test/federation` on
every authenticated call to prove the federation chain works
end-to-end (Keycloak JWT → Vault OIDC login → KV read). The
producer-side path is hard-coded at
[`backend/src/meho_backplane/api/v1/health.py:68`](../../backend/src/meho_backplane/api/v1/health.py#L68)
and intentionally not configurable in v0.1 — per-route customisation
of which secret to read lands with the first connector post-Goal-2.

The data at this exact path **must exist** when smoke leg #4
("Vault federation works") is run, otherwise the read fails with
`vault.read_ok=false` + `detail="read_failed: InvalidPath"` and the
smoke verifier exits 1 even though the entire rest of the
federation chain (auth, login, role binding, policy) is healthy.
The diagnostic is misleading because the failure looks like a chain
break when it's actually a missing fixture.

Provisioning command (one-time, value content immaterial):

```bash
vault kv put secret/meho/test/federation \
  purpose="MEHO v0.1 federation-proof fixture" \
  note="Read by /api/v1/health; absence breaks smoke.sh leg #4"
```

The value's *content* is never read by the backplane — only the
presence of the path is asserted (via hvac's KV v2 metadata
read returning a non-error response with a `version` field). Any
non-empty key set works; the two keys above are a self-documenting
default the lab admin can grep for during incident response.

## Verification

Run from any host with the operator's Vault token (`vault login`
against the operator's Keycloak identity, OR a service-account
JWT bound to the same role).

```bash
# 1. JWT auth method exists with correct discovery URL
#    (auth/jwt/ — the dedicated mount, NOT auth/oidc/)
vault read -format=json auth/jwt/config \
  | jq '{oidc_discovery_url, default_role}'

# 2. Role exists with correct audience binding
vault read -format=json auth/jwt/role/meho-mcp \
  | jq '{bound_audiences, user_claim, role_type, policies}'

# 3. Policy grants meho/* read
vault policy read meho-mcp

# 4. KV mount is v2 at the expected prefix
vault secrets list -format=json \
  | jq '."secret/" | {type, options}'
# Expect: type="kv", options.version="2"

# 5. Federation-proof fixture exists
vault kv get -format=json secret/meho/test/federation \
  | jq '.data.metadata.version'
# Expect: a positive integer (the KV-v2 version number).
# A "No value found at secret/data/meho/test/federation" error is
# the smoking gun for missing surface #5.
```

When commands 1-5 all return non-error output and the JSON
extractions are populated, the backplane's federation chain has
everything it needs from Vault.

## Failure modes the consumer should expect

| Failure | Diagnostic on the producer side | Consumer-side fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=false`, `detail="login_failed: VaultUnreachableError"` | TCP / TLS / timeout to `VAULT_ADDR`. The readiness probe `/ready` also reports `vault` as unhealthy. | Verify `VAULT_ADDR` resolves and is reachable from the backplane Pod's network policy (egress to Vault is in the chart's NetworkPolicy by default — check `networkPolicy.vaultCIDR`) |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=false`, `detail="login_failed: VaultRoleDeniedError"` | Vault accepted the connection but rejected the JWT for the configured role. | Verify surface 2 (role binding). Most often: `bound_audiences` doesn't match the audience the backplane is forwarding (cross-check `KEYCLOAK_AUDIENCE` env var against `vault read auth/jwt/role/meho-mcp`) |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=false`, `detail="login_failed: …"`; Vault server log shows `error configuring token validator: unsupported config type` | The `meho-mcp` `role_type=jwt` role was created on an `auth/oidc/` mount that's in OIDC-login mode. Vault (≥1.21.2) refuses `role_type=jwt` on an OIDC-configured mount. | Move the JWT method + role to a **dedicated mount** per surface 1 (`vault auth enable -path=jwt jwt`) and set `VAULT_OIDC_MOUNT_PATH` to match. Do not co-locate with an interactive-OIDC-login mount. (evoila/meho#553) |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=true`, `vault.read_ok=false`, `detail="read_failed: InvalidPath"` | **Missing surface 5** — federation-proof KV path doesn't exist. | Run the provisioning command from surface 5 above |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=true`, `vault.read_ok=false`, `detail="read_failed: Forbidden"` | **Missing surface 3** — policy doesn't grant read on `secret/meho/*`. | Verify surface 3 (`vault policy read meho-mcp`); the policy must include both `secret/data/meho/*` and `secret/metadata/meho/*` |
| `/api/v1/health` returns `vault.reachable=true`, `vault.read_ok=false`, `detail="read_failed: KeyError"` or `read_failed: TypeError` | Vault returned an unexpected payload shape — KV-v1 mount instead of v2, proxy mangling the response, etc. | Verify surface 4 (KV v2 mount); the mount must be type `kv` with `options.version="2"` |
