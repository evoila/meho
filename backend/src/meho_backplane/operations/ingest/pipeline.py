"""End-to-end ingestion-pipeline service + connector-list query helper.

This module bundles the three T1 / T2 / T3 stages into one
service-layer entry point the REST router (T6,
:mod:`meho_backplane.api.v1.connectors_ingest`), CLI verbs (T5), and
admin MCP tools (T7) all consume:

* :class:`IngestionPipelineService` — orchestrates parse →
  ``register_ingested_operations`` → ``run_llm_grouping`` for a
  ``(product, version, impl_id)`` connector triple ingesting one or
  more OpenAPI specs.
* :func:`list_ingested_connectors` — aggregates
  :class:`~meho_backplane.db.models.OperationGroup` rows into one
  :class:`~meho_backplane.operations.ingest.api_schemas.ConnectorListItem`
  per visible connector.

Both surfaces are tenant-scoped at construction time: the service is
built from an :class:`Operator` and every operation acts on either
``tenant_id == operator.tenant_id`` or ``tenant_id is None`` (built-in
scope, gated on :class:`TenantRole.TENANT_ADMIN`). Cross-tenant probes
raise :class:`ConnectorNotFoundError` — the same conflation
:class:`ReviewService` uses to keep the operator-facing failure
surface uniform.

LLM-client injection
--------------------

The grouping pass requires an :class:`LlmClient` Protocol
implementation. The production adapter ships and is wired at FastAPI
lifespan startup (#1386):
:func:`~meho_backplane.operations.ingest.build_anthropic_ingest_llm_client`
is installed via :func:`set_llm_client_factory`
(:mod:`meho_backplane.api.v1.connectors_ingest`), reading
``settings.anthropic_api_key`` (the same key the agent runtime uses)
into a real Anthropic Messages-API client. To keep T6's REST surface
workable in tests as well, the pipeline accepts an injectable factory
at construction time; the fail-closed default factory raises
:class:`LlmClientUnavailable` so calling
``POST /api/v1/connectors/ingest`` against a backplane that configured
no key returns 503 rather than crashing. Sibling tests inject their
own deterministic stub via
``IngestionPipelineService(..., llm_client_factory=...)``; the
CLI / REST / MCP surfaces all read the same lifespan-wired factory,
so ``meho connector ingest --catalog <product>/<version>`` groups for
real on a deploy with ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` set and fails closed with
503 on one without. See G0.18-T7 (#1360) for the prior build-time-only
framing this replaces.

Multi-spec merge
----------------

A single :meth:`IngestionPipelineService.ingest` call processes a
list of :class:`SpecSource` entries. Each spec is parsed and upserted
under the same connector triple with the spec's ``uri`` as the
``spec_source`` tag (see
:func:`register_ingested_operations`'s docstring for the tagging
contract). Counts in the returned :class:`IngestionResult` aggregate
across all specs in the request.

Dry run
-------

``dry_run=True`` short-circuits both the DB writes and the LLM call:
the pipeline parses every spec and counts how many operations would
land but does not touch ``endpoint_descriptor`` or
``operation_group``. The response carries ``grouping=None`` and
``ingestion.connector_registered=False`` because neither stage was
exercised. Useful for operators validating a spec before committing.

           parse — just enough to read the ``info`` block).

           a ``compatible`` outcome emits a structured
           ``connector_ingest_version_drift`` event and proceeds.
        3. After collecting every spec's ``info.version``, the bundle
           is checked for internal consistency: two specs sharing a
           major version are fine (same connector triple); two specs
           disagreeing on the major version are not, and raise
           :class:`VersionMismatchError` with
           ``kind="multi_spec_inconsistent"``.

        Specs missing ``info.version`` entirely contribute ``None`` to
        the collected list; they're skipped for the cross-check
        (older specs without ``info.version`` can still be ingested
        under whatever label).

        The cross-check runs early — before the parser does the full
        operation walk — so an obviously-misclassified ingest fails
        in milliseconds rather than after we've spent CPU parsing a
        2,000-op spec.

        ``spec_info_versions_compatible`` is the catalog row's opt-in
        compatibility range (G0.16-T5 #1307). When non-``None``,
        per-spec classification bypasses the verbatim/major-band check
        for any spec whose ``info.version`` matches a pattern in the
        range — the catalog has explicitly declared its label
        (e.g. ``"3"`` for gh-rest) decouples from the spec's
        documentation version (``"1.1.4"`` and growing on
        ``rest-api-description``). The multi-spec consistency pass
        still runs over the per-spec list so two specs whose
        ``info.version`` values fall in different majors still trip
        ``multi_spec_inconsistent`` — the opt-in only widens the
