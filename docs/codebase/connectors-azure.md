# Azure connector

MEHO reads Azure subscriptions through the Azure connector. One target is one
subscription. The connector logs in to Microsoft Entra ID with a login (a
service principal) from Vault, keeps the access token in its own cache, and
calls Azure Resource Manager (Azure's management API) with it.

Today the connector has one operation, `azure.about`. Later reads (inventory,
compute, network, storage, cost and more) build on the login and the cache
described here.

Package: `backend/src/meho_backplane/connectors/azure/`. Shared login code:
`backend/src/meho_backplane/connectors/_shared/microsoft_login.py`.

## Overview

| What | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | `azure` |
| Connector ID | `azure-arm-2026.10` (implementation `azure-arm`, version `2026.10`) |
| Registration | the versioned row plus the wildcard row `("azure", "", "")` |
| Kind | typed operations only; nothing is ingested from a spec |
| Operations | `azure.about` (group `account`, `safe`) |

Azure has no product version, so the version is a date, like
`hetzner-rest-2026.04`. The wildcard row lets every `azure` target find the
connector, also a new target without a fingerprint.

Why typed only: Azure publishes its API descriptions as Swagger 2.0, which
MEHO's spec ingestion does not read. Hand-written operations also give clear
groups, risk levels and guidance for the AI.

## Key types

- `AzureConnector` (`connector.py`): the connector on the shared HTTP base
  (`connectors/adapters/http.py`). It owns the login, the cache, the two
  recovery hooks, the fingerprint and the probe.
- `AzureCloud`, `AZURE_CLOUDS`, `AzureTargetConfig`, `resolve_target_config`
  (`session.py`): the target shape and its checks.
- `AzureCredentials`, `parse_credentials`, `load_credentials_from_vault`
  (`session.py`): the secret shape and the reader.
- `fetch_client_credentials_token`, `MicrosoftAccessToken`,
  `MicrosoftLoginError`, `LOGIN_HOSTS` (`_shared/microsoft_login.py`): one
  token request to Microsoft Entra ID. The Entra ID connector can reuse it with
  another scope.
- `AZURE_TYPED_OPS`, `AZURE_TYPED_WHEN_TO_USE_BY_GROUP`,
  `register_azure_typed_operations` (`typed_ops.py`): the operation table, the
  group texts and the start-up registrar.
- `_paths.py`: every Resource Manager path and API version the connector
  calls, so a CI check can compare them with Azure's API description files.

## Target shape

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `host` | the Resource Manager host of the cloud: `management.azure.com` for the public cloud |
| `port` | empty or `443` |
| `secret_ref` | the secret with the login (see below) |
| `extras.subscription_id` | required: the subscription ID, a GUID |
| `extras.tenant_id` | optional: the tenant (directory) ID, a GUID; must equal the secret's `tenant_id` |
| `extras.cloud` | optional: `AzureCloud` (default), `AzureUSGovernment` or `AzureChinaCloud` |

The clouds:

| Cloud | Resource Manager host | Login host | Token scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AzureCloud` | `management.azure.com` | `login.microsoftonline.com` | `https://management.azure.com/.default` |
| `AzureUSGovernment` | `management.usgovcloudapi.net` | `login.microsoftonline.us` | `https://management.core.usgovcloudapi.net/.default` |
| `AzureChinaCloud` | `management.chinacloudapi.cn` | `login.chinacloudapi.cn` | `https://management.chinacloudapi.cn/.default` |

The hosts and scopes are the ones Microsoft's own Python SDK uses. Only
`AzureCloud` is proven on a live tenant; the other two are not proven.

Before any login, `resolve_target_config` checks the target. MEHO sends the
access token only to the Resource Manager host of the target's cloud, over
https on port 443, with the certificate checked (`verify_tls` must stay on).
A target with another host, `extras.scheme=http`, another port, a bad GUID or
an unknown cloud fails with `AzureTargetConfigError`. The message names the
target and the field to fix, never a value.

## Secret shape

The secret at the target's `secret_ref` holds three keys:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `tenant_id` | the tenant (directory) ID, a GUID |
| `client_id` | the application (client) ID of the login, a GUID |
| `client_secret` | the client secret of the login |

Other keys are ignored. Every value is stripped of surrounding white space.
A missing or empty key, or an ID that is not a GUID, fails with
`AzureSecretShapeError`. The message names the key and the secret reference,
never a value. Several targets may share one secret.

The secret is read with the shared reader
(`connectors/_shared/vault_creds.py`, `load_vault_secret_data`), under the
caller's own identity, so the read works for every secret store MEHO supports.

If the target sets `extras.tenant_id` and it is not the secret's `tenant_id`,
the call fails before the login with a clear message.

## Login

`fetch_client_credentials_token` sends one request:

```
POST https://<login host>/<tenant_id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=...&client_secret=...&scope=<token scope>
```

Microsoft answers with `access_token` and `expires_in` (seconds; tokens live
60 to 90 minutes). There is no refresh token in this flow: MEHO asks for a new
token when the old one runs out.

The request is made once and never retried, so it cannot stack with MEHO's
own retries. Results:

| Answer | What MEHO does |
|---|---|
| 200 with `access_token` and `expires_in` | returns the token |
| 400, 401 or 403 (the login was refused) | raises `ConnectorAuthError` with the HTTP status, the OAuth 2.0 error code and the `AADSTS` numbers, and the hint to check the secret |
| any other status (for example 429 or 5xx), no connection, or an answer without a usable token | raises `MicrosoftLoginError` |

No error text holds the client secret or a token.

From the token MEHO reads the login's app ID (claim `appid`, or `azp` in a
version 2 token), object ID (`oid`) and tenant ID (`tid`). It does not check
the signature and uses the values only to show them. Microsoft may change the
token format, so each value is empty when the token cannot be read.

### Why MEHO makes the request itself

The plan was to use Microsoft's `azure-identity` library. We checked version
1.27.0 (with `azure-core` 1.41.0 and `msal` 1.39.0) and it does not fit MEHO's
login flow:

- Its credential object keeps its own token cache. A second request on the
  same object returned the same token without a call, so after a 401 it would
  hand back the rejected token unless MEHO threw the object away each time.
- It retries the token request itself (up to 10 times, with waits of up to
  120 seconds) unless told not to, and MSAL repeats a stored 429, 5xx or 400
  answer for a while without asking again.
- Every new credential object first reads Microsoft's login settings, so each
  login is two calls (three when it fails).
- The sync credential runs on `requests` and needs a thread; the async one
  needs `aiohttp`. Neither runs on MEHO's HTTP client, so the tests could not
  mock it with respx.
- It adds four packages.

With all of that turned off, one request is left, which MEHO already makes the
same way for Keycloak. So MEHO makes it itself, with `httpx`, and adds no
package.

## Token cache

`AzureConnector` keeps two caches:

- **Secret cache**, per MEHO tenant, target and secret reference.
- **Token cache**, per MEHO tenant, target, Azure tenant, client ID and token
  scope. MEHO asks for a new token five minutes before the old one runs out
  (Microsoft's own SDK uses the same margin).

Each cache key has its own lock. When ten calls need a new token at the same
time, one call logs in and the other nine wait and then use its token. Azure
does not cancel an older token when it makes a new one, so two targets that
share one login cannot spoil each other's token.

A call without a person's token (an empty `raw_jwt`, or MEHO's own system
identity) never gets a cached secret or token. It must read the secret itself,
and for a system call that read fails on purpose.

## Recovery

Both hooks are called by the dispatcher (`operations/dispatcher.py`).

- **Azure answers 401** (the token is no longer accepted): the dispatcher
  calls `invalidate_session(target)`, which drops the target's tokens, and
  tries the call once more. The retry logs in again with the cached secret.
- **Microsoft refuses the login**: the dispatcher gets `ConnectorAuthError`,
  calls `invalidate_credentials(target)`, which drops the target's secret and
  tokens, and returns `connector_auth_failed` with the hint. It does not retry.
  After the operator fixes the secret, the next call reads it again. No
  restart is needed.

Other failures keep the shared behaviour: the HTTP base retries a failed GET
on a lost connection or a 5xx, a 403 becomes the "missing permission" error,
and other statuses become `connector_error`.

## azure.about, fingerprint and probe

`azure.about` (group `account`, `safe`, no parameters) reads
`GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}?api-version=2022-12-01` and returns:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `subscription_id`, `display_name`, `state`, `tenant_id` | the Resource Manager answer |
| `cloud` | the target |
| `app_id`, `object_id` | the claims of the access token |

The token itself is never returned. `display_name` is text from Azure; the
guidance for the AI says to treat it as data.

`fingerprint` reads the same subscription and stores vendor `microsoft`,
product `azure`, no version, and `extras` with `subscription_id`,
`tenant_id`, `cloud` and `state`. `meho targets probe` stores this result.
When the read fails, the fingerprint is `reachable=False` with the reason in
`extras.error`. `probe` uses the fingerprint. A call without an operator runs
as MEHO's system identity, which cannot read the secret, so it reports
`reachable=False`.

## Dependencies

- `connectors/adapters/http.py`: pooled `httpx` client, blocking of private
  addresses, trace recording, retry of failed GET requests.
- `connectors/_shared/vault_creds.py`: the operator-context secret read.
- `connectors/_shared/vcf_auth.py`: `ConnectorAuthError` (the refused-login
  error the dispatcher knows) and the `auth_model` check.
- `connectors/_shared/system_operator.py`: recognising MEHO's system identity.
- `operations/typed_register.py`: storing the typed operations at start-up.

## Known issues

- Only the public cloud (`AzureCloud`) is proven on a live tenant.
- No 429 handling yet: a "too many requests" answer from Azure or from the
  login service becomes a plain error. One retry budget, waiting for
  `Retry-After`, paging and long-running operations come next.
- The check of the hand-written paths against Azure's pinned API description
  files arrives with those files; `_paths.py` is ready for it.
- The cache lives in one MEHO process. Each process logs in on its own.
