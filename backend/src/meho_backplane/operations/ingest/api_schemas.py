"""Pydantic-v2 request / response models for the connectors-ingest surface.

Shared by the REST router (G0.7-T6, ``api/v1/connectors_ingest.py``)
and the admin MCP tools (G0.7-T7, ``mcp/tools/connector_admin.py``).
Both surfaces hit the same service layer in :mod:`pipeline` and
:mod:`service`; defining the request / response shapes once lets the
sibling tasks consume them verbatim rather than rebuilding parallel
Pydantic trees.

The shapes are deliberately conservative:

* ``frozen=True`` on every model — responses flow read-only and any
  in-place mutation surfaces as a Pydantic error rather than a
  silently-modified payload.
* ``extra="forbid"`` on every **request** body (G0.9-T2 / #729):
  :class:`IngestRequest`, :class:`SpecSource`, :class:`EditGroupBody`,
  :class:`EditOpBody`. Unknown fields fail 422 ``extra_forbidden`` at
  the framework boundary instead of being silently dropped, so a v0.2.1
  client mis-spelling ``impl_id`` as ``implementation_id`` (or the
  RDC-team-style ``q`` / ``top_k`` carryover) hears about it
  immediately rather than seeing a confusing required-field error or
  silent default. Response models keep the pydantic default
  (``extra="ignore"``) — they aren't validated against client input.
* ``IngestRequest.specs`` is a list of :class:`SpecSource` objects with
  one ``uri`` field so future per-spec knobs (auth headers, dialect
  pinning) can land without breaking the wire contract.
* :class:`ConnectorListItem` projects the minimum set the operator
  needs from :class:`OperationGroup` aggregation — connector_id +
  parsed coordinates + tenant scope + per-status group counts. It
  intentionally omits per-op detail because the review payload
  (:class:`ConnectorReviewPayload`) is the right place to surface
  that.

Status filter for ``GET /api/v1/connectors``: the operator picks
``staged`` / ``enabled`` / ``disabled`` / ``all``. The semantics:

* ``staged`` — at least one group is in ``review_status='staged'``;
  the connector is awaiting review.
* ``enabled`` — every group is ``review_status='enabled'``; the
  connector is fully live.
* ``disabled`` — every group is ``review_status='disabled'``; the
  connector is fully rolled back.
* ``all`` (or ``None`` query param) — no filter, return every visible
  connector.

A connector with a mixed group state (some enabled, some staged)
shows in the ``staged`` filter — the operator-facing question is "is
there anything left to review" and the answer is yes. This is the
same conservative shape T5's CLI ``meho connector list --status
staged`` will hit.

    """One spec to ingest under a connector triple.

    ``uri`` is the operator's spec identifier and audit label. When the
    spec is *fetched* by the backend, only an ``https://`` URL is
    accepted -- the G0.16-T8 (#95) SSRF / local-file guard rejects
    ``http``, ``file://``, and bare paths so a spec URI cannot become a
    network-topology or filesystem oracle.

    ``content`` carries the spec text inline. The ``meho`` CLI reads
    ``docs:<connector-id>/<file>`` and ``file://`` sources **CLI-side**
    and uploads the bytes here, leaving ``uri`` as the audit label, so
    no local path or non-https scheme reaches the backend. When
    ``content`` is set the backend uses it verbatim (size-capped) and
    skips the fetch; when absent, ``uri`` is fetched under the https
    guard. A bare ``docs:`` URI that reaches the backend with no
    ``content`` is rejected with :exc:`UnsupportedSpecError` (#1535).

    Wrapped in its own model so future per-spec knobs (auth headers,
    dialect pinning, content-type override) can land without
    reshaping :class:`IngestRequest`. ``extra="forbid"`` rejects
    unknown fields (per the request-schema-strictness rule) so a
    typo in a nested ``specs[*]`` entry fails 422 at the body parse
    instead of being silently dropped.

    Drives a full pipeline run: parse every spec in *specs*, call
    :func:`register_ingested_operations` once per spec under the same
    ``(product, version, impl_id)`` connector triple, then run
    :func:`run_llm_grouping` once for the whole connector. Multi-spec
    ingestion (vCenter's ``vcenter.yaml`` + ``vi-json.yaml``) lands as
    multiple ``SpecSource`` entries in one request.

    Two mutually-exclusive request shapes:

    * **Explicit-quadruple shape** — ``product`` + ``version`` +
      ``impl_id`` + ``specs[]`` carry the resolved triple plus the
      spec sources the caller already knows. The MCP admin tool and
      the historical CLI manual mode use this shape.
    * **Catalog-driven shape** (G0.14-T9 / #1150) — ``catalog_entry``
      carries a ``"<product>/<version>"`` reference; the route
      handler resolves the entry against the packaged catalog (see
      :mod:`meho_backplane.operations.ingest.catalog`) and fills in
      ``product`` / ``version`` / ``impl_id`` / ``specs[]`` from the
      catalog entry before dispatching through the existing ingest
      path. REST-native agent runtimes that can't shell out to the
      CLI use this shape; the CLI's ``--catalog`` flag has been
      refactored to POST this shape rather than resolving the entry
      client-side.

    The two shapes are mutually exclusive: a body that sets
    ``catalog_entry`` alongside any of ``product`` / ``version`` /
    ``impl_id`` / ``specs[]`` fails 422 ``catalog_entry_conflict`` at
    the validator below. A body that sets neither fails 422
    ``ingest_request_underspecified``. ``base_url`` and ``dry_run``
    are accepted in both shapes.

    ``dry_run=True`` skips both the DB writes and the grouping pass:
    only :func:`parse_openapi` runs, and the response carries
    :class:`IngestionResultModel` counts derived from the parse output
    plus ``grouping=None``. Operators use the dry-run path to validate
    a spec before committing.

    ``base_url`` is the optional default base URL for the auto-
    registered :class:`GenericRestConnector` shim; ``None`` leaves
    the shim unconfigured (the connector's eventual hand-coded
    subclass at G3.x will set its own base URL).

    ``extra="forbid"`` rejects unknown body fields with 422
    ``extra_forbidden`` (G0.9-T2 / #729) — silent-drop on a typo
    would otherwise mean the pipeline runs with the wrong impl_id
    and the operator only finds out at review-time.

    ``product`` / ``version`` / ``impl_id`` are the parsed triple.

    ``tenant_id`` is ``None`` for built-in / global connectors and a
    UUID for tenant-curated ones. ``group_count`` totals the rows
    visible to the caller; the three ``*_group_count`` fields split
    that total by ``review_status`` so operators can spot
    review-queue backlog at a glance.

    (the dispatchability flag that survives connector-level
    enable/disable cycles via operator overrides). Useful for the
    CLI's ``meho connector list --status staged`` summary view and
    for an LLM browsing the catalog: ``vmware-rest-9.0`` ingests
    ~2,211 ops of which only a fraction are enabled, and before the
    split nothing on the row said which of the two numbers
    ``operation_count`` was.

    (``"ingested"`` — DB-backed, resolves through the dispatcher) from
    *registered-but-empty* rows (``"registered"`` — v2-registry entries
    without descriptor rows yet). Rows that wouldn't round-trip
    through the resolver at all (stale-impl_id DB rows, v2 entries
    whose registry product disagrees with the parser's derived
    product) are filtered out before the response is built;
    ``connector_id``s the listing emits are guaranteed to resolve
    through :func:`~meho_backplane.operations._lookup.connector_exists`
    when ``state == "ingested"``, and explicitly labelled
    not-yet-dispatchable when ``state == "registered"``. Defaults to
    ``"ingested"`` so existing call sites (tests, MCP fakes)
    construct rows without breakage.

    ``next_step`` (G0.13-T3 / #1133) is the self-describing hint that
    closes the workflow gap the v0.6.0 RDC dogfood surfaced (signal 11:
    half-registered connectors fail lookup with no in-product hint
    about what verb closes the workflow). It is a :class:`NextStep`
    object on ``state="registered"`` rows and ``None`` on
    ``state="ingested"`` rows (no operator action remains for an
    ingested connector). The hint is computed against the curated
    connector-spec catalog (#743): when the catalog carries an entry
    for the registry's ``(product, version)`` the verb points at
    ``meho connector ingest --catalog ...``; otherwise it points at
    the manual-mode flags. Defaults to ``None`` so existing
    construction call sites (tests, MCP fakes) continue to compile
    without explicit assignment.

    producers, both keyed off the enable-time resolver probe that
    classifies the connector ``is_enabled=True`` would dispatch through
    (G0.28-T5 #1971 split the original single ``unreplaced_auto_shim``
    code into a tri-state vocabulary mirroring
    :data:`~meho_backplane.connectors.base.ShimKind`):

    * ``unreplaced_auto_shim`` — the resolved connector is the
      unconfigured bare ingest auto-shim
      (:class:`~meho_backplane.operations.ingest.connector_registration.GenericRestConnector`,
      ``shim_kind == "bare"``). Dispatch is then guaranteed to fail with
      the ``connector_unsupported`` / ``cause='unreplaced_auto_shim'``
      structured error (G0.23-T1 #1627). The remediation is to write the
      per-product Connector subclass; re-ingesting will not replace it.
    * ``profiled_but_unreviewed`` — the resolved connector is a
      :class:`~meho_backplane.connectors.profiled.ProfiledRestConnector`
      (``shim_kind == "profiled"``). A profiled connector IS
      dispatchable, so this is not a dead end — but stamping its
      :class:`ExecutionProfile` deliberately did not auto-enable
      dispatch (the review gate is the load-bearing interlock, #1971),
      and this ``is_enabled=True`` write is the operator clearing that
      gate. The advisory confirms that the enable — not the stamp — is
      what made the op callable, so the operator owns the decision.

    ``code`` reuses the dispatch-time cause vocabulary verbatim
    (``unreplaced_auto_shim``) for the bare case so an operator — or an
    SDK — can correlate the proactive warning with the reactive
    dispatch error without a translation table. The ``Literal`` union is
    extended additively (client-compatible) as new tiers gain advisories.

    ``connector_class`` carries the resolved connector class's name
    (``AutoShim_<product>_<version>_<impl_id>`` for a bare shim; the
    profiled subclass's ``__name__`` for the profiled case) — the same
    key the dispatch error's ``extras`` payload uses. ``message`` is the

    * **Identity** -- ``job_id`` + the originator's request descriptors
      (``catalog_entry`` / ``product`` / ``version`` / ``impl_id`` /
      ``spec_uris``). Echo so the polling caller doesn't need to

    * **Lifecycle** -- ``status`` + ``started_at`` + optional
      ``ended_at``. Status moves ``running`` → one of ``succeeded`` /
      ``degraded`` / ``failed`` exactly once.
    * **Result vs error** -- keyed on status. ``succeeded`` populates
      ``ingestion`` (with optional ``grouping``) and leaves ``error``
      ``None``; ``failed`` populates ``error`` / ``error_class`` and

      ``error_class`` carry the reason). ``running`` leaves them ``None``

    discriminator -- the Python exception class name for ``failed``
    (``VersionMismatchError`` vs ``LlmClientUnavailable``), or the fixed
    ``ingested_not_dispatchable`` token for ``degraded`` -- so agents
    branch without parsing prose. The structured 422 envelopes the
