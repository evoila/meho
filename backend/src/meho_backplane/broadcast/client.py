"""Async Valkey client + lifespan management.

The backplane reaches Valkey (Redis-protocol-compatible) through
redis-py's asyncio API (:mod:`redis.asyncio`). One client per process;
the connection pool is hung off the client object so subsequent
:func:`get_broadcast_client` callers share connections.

Mirrors the SQLAlchemy ``db/engine`` lifecycle (see
:mod:`meho_backplane.db.engine`):

* :func:`get_broadcast_client` returns the cached client, building it
  on first call from ``BROADCAST_REDIS_URL`` in :class:`Settings`. The
  client itself is **lazy** about TCP — :func:`redis.asyncio.from_url`
  parses the URL and constructs the connection pool, but the first
  socket isn't opened until the first command runs. Re-instantiation
  in the same process is therefore cheap; the singleton avoids
  creating parallel pools per request.
* :func:`dispose_broadcast_client` is awaited from the FastAPI
  lifespan shutdown phase. ``aclose`` is the redis-py asyncio idiom —
  the synchronous ``close`` cannot reach connections that were spawned
  on a different event loop, mirroring the same warning the SQLAlchemy
  2.x async docs make for ``AsyncEngine.dispose``.
* :func:`reset_broadcast_client_for_testing` clears the cache without
  calling ``aclose``. Tests use it after monkey-patching
  ``BROADCAST_REDIS_URL`` to force the next
  :func:`get_broadcast_client` call to read the new value.

    Called from the FastAPI ``lifespan`` shutdown phase so the

    be ``await``\\ ed in async contexts — calling the synchronous
    ``close`` leaves connections reachable only from a different event
    loop, which the GC cannot reliably close. Idempotent: calling
    twice (or before any :func:`get_broadcast_client` call) is a
    silent no-op even when the first ``aclose`` raises.

    The cache is cleared **before** ``aclose`` is awaited so a failure
    in the close path doesn't leave the module pointing at a
    half-closed client; the next ``dispose_broadcast_client`` /
    ``get_broadcast_client`` call therefore starts from a clean slate
    rather than re-entering ``aclose`` on the same potentially-broken
    object. Shutdown-path ``aclose`` failures are logged via structlog

    shutdown and prevent neighbouring disposers from running).
